A code which simulates an Enigma Machine.

This code was created during a brief obsession with the Enigma Machine as a marvel of engineering.
I decided to simulate it using my knowledge of Python. Over 150 Quintillion different codes could come in handy someday right?
I was eventually able to implement all the scrambling methods of the machine, the hardest being the Plugboard, which in turn gave the highest level of scrambling.
Please keep in mind that this code was a fun project and not meant for any sort of professional use. I tried to make the code as intuitive as possible but in the end some things may make sense to only me.
If you have any suggestions on how to improve this code please feel free to leave it here.
